Project/lab description pdf file can be found in the repo. 
Created a simple website that gets user's fruit order info (apples, oranges, and bananas) and Javascript is used to 
check its validity. If valid, PHP is used to update a order.txt file on the number of fruits ever ordered. An order 
receipt is then sent to the user.
